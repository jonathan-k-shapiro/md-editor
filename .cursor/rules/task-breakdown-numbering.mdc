# Task Breakdown Numbering

When breaking down tasks from project specifications or development phases, always use hierarchical numbering that aligns with the existing document structure.

## Numbering Pattern
- **Phase.Task.Subtask** format (e.g., 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.)
- **Phase number** corresponds to development phases (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
- **Task number** corresponds to the task order within that phase 
- **Subtask number** corresponds to the detailed breakdown of that specific task

## Examples

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
├── 1.1 Set up development environment and CI/CD
│ ├── 1.1.1 Project Structure & Repository Setup
│ ├── 1.1.2 Backend Development Environment
│ └── 1.1.3 Frontend Development Environment
├── 1.2 Implement authentication system
│ ├── 1.2.1 JWT Token Implementation
│ └── 1.2.2 User Registration Flow

## Application
- Use this numbering when breaking down any task from a specification document
- Maintain consistency with the parent document's structure
- Include the full hierarchical number in task headers
- Use checkboxes for all subtasks to track progress
- Group related subtasks under logical categories
